Control flow refers to the order of statements are executed or evaluated when a program is running. If you look at the playground you've been working in you'll notice that each statement you type is evaluated line-by-line starting at the top.  \nSoftware is rarely so straightforward.  In this section we're going to look at a few ways to evaluate current conditions in order to know what we should do."
